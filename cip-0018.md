## Abstract ##

For public API calls, it's a default security practice to limit results by
pagination, however, removing some API limits for private counterparty servers
lets developers leverage simpler API call logic that could result in less
failures related to network latency and non-programming errors. On the other
end of the spectrum, there's cases where a lower limit is desireable.

## Motivation ##

Recently some projects have started using private counterparty federated nodes
to interact with the counterparty api, and in those scenarios API limits don't
make sense as there's no risk of getting external DDoS attacks due to the lack
of pagination. In these scenarios, a well versed devops could leverage this
network setup to let developers simplify calls to the API server and reduce
errors originated on latency and erroneous calls. A special provision has been
taken into account to allow different limits altogheter, allowing a setting
where the operator can even lower the query limit.

## Rationale ##

Introducing a new configuration flag should let devops teams tune their server
deployment according to the network security requirements. However, care must
be taken that no default deployment is left unprotected due to this new
behaviour.

## Technical Implementation ##

Adding an `API_LIMIT_ROWS` flag in `config.py`, making it configurable from the
counterparty-cli code, and acting on its setting in `api.py`.

When `API_LIMIT_ROWS` is set to a value >= 1, the results are limited to that
amount of rows in all related queries. When `API_LIMIT_ROWS` is set to 0 the
limit isn't enforced, and the server will reply with all the result set.

Adding output to the `get_running_info` API call to inform the developers as to
what limit has been set on the currently used server.

As there's no consensus change in this modification, there's no need for unit
testing, however testing on real servers should be done to attest the
implementation's fit for the task before accepting the code in master.

## Milestones ##

**Fundraising Goal = 75 XCP**

**Milestone #1** (60% - 45 XCP)
Implementation of the configuration flag in Counterparty-lib and
Counterparty-cli.

**Milestone #2** (15% - 11.25 XCP)
Testing the new feature on a public server.

**Milestone #3** (25% - 18.75 XCP)
Merge to master of the code.

**Bounty Address** : TBD
