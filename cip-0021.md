## Abstract ##

A mechanism to swap tokens for on-chain BTC without the need for a third signed
message, unlike BTCPay which needs interaction to honor the match, hence
introducing counterparty risk.

## Motivation ##

BTCPay messages for token trading are a UX mess: a user need to create a message
that expresses the willingness to exchange BTC for a token, the second user then
escrows the token to this message and then the first user must send the required
BTC to the escrowing user to finish the exchange.

Granted, this feature has seen little use due to this complicated arrangement.
This also creates a scenario where people can avoid honoring the escrowing user
with the BTC send, creating a counterparty risk where an address can lose the
tx fee and in a worse scenario, via blockchain timeout, the honored BTC.

## Rationale ##

Having a mechanism which gives out a fixed amount of tokens for a given amount
of on-chain BTC solves the scenario where the escrowing party doesn't needs to
rely on the buyer to honor a previous intent.

"Dispensers" just dispense tokens equivalent to fixed quantities of BTC received
by an address, removing the need for order matching with BTC (which can't be
escrowed on-chain). Excess BTC shouldn't be sent by the buying party as the
seller doesn't has motivation to honor back this remnant.

## Technical implementation ##

A new message type under the CIP11 numbering should be allocated for address
dispenser messages.

The dispenser must specify the following fields:

  * New Message ID: ````0x0C````
  * Asset Id of the given out asset
  * The given quantity of the asset to put on the dispenser
  * The amount of the asset to give on each swap
  * The satoshi rate to unit of token given out
  * The state of the dispenser (0 open, 10 closed)
  * Message ID ````0x0D```` is reserved for dispense internal messages

Dispensers can get drained to the point that it cannot dispense assets anymore.
In this state the dispenser will automatically close and the remaining balance
on escrow will be returned by the opener of the dispenser.

# API Changes

### create_dispenser

`create_dispenser` creates a dispenser message:

 * **asset** : The address receiving the assets and/or ownerships.
 * **give_quantity**: The amount of the asset this dispenser gives out on each
 dispense action.
 * **escrow_quantity**: The total amount of the asset that will be escrowed to
 this dispenser. It's suggested but not required that this is always a
 multiple of give_quantity.
 * **mainchainrate**: The amount of main chain asset (BTC in case of
 Counterparty) this dispenser must receive in order to dispense at least
 _give_quantity_ of _asset_. The amount received, divided by _mainchainrate_,
 rounded down to the nearest integer and multiplied by _give_quantity_ is the
 amount of _asset_ the sending address will receive.
 * **status**: 0 for opening a dispenser. 10 for closing. When closing a
 dispenser the values of _give_quantity_, _escrow_quantity_ and _mainchainrate_
 are ignored. It is suggested that the caller sets them to 0 in case of future
 use for other purposes.

### get_dispensers

gets the dispensers from the database, in the same manner as other get_* ops.
