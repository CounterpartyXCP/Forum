## Abstract ##

Fix the issue when creating dividends where the payment is done with non-divisible
assets over a divisible asset. Also, change the protocol to not write 0 quantity
dividend credits.

## Motivation ##

Payouts of dividends of non-divisible assets is broken and non-functional because
of a bug in the handling of divisibility information at the moment of handing out
the credits.

## Rationale ##

Several projects in the Counterparty ecosystem are using this characteristic to
distribute newly minted collectibles to holders of a certain bearer token,
rendering the potentiality of this feature useless as distributing a non divisible
asset over a divisible asset almost never works as expected.

## Technical implementation ##

Fixing `dividend.py` on the validate and parse sections to properly calculate
amounts for this kind of transactions.

# API Changes

No api changes.

# Consensus Changes

The activation of this fix will require an activation block, records with 0
credits will stop to be generated after this. Previous sent dividends that
failed because of this bug should still fail, only after the activation block
the dividends trigering this bug will be valid.
